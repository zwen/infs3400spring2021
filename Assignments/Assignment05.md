## Assignment 05 - Coding Exercise

### While we waiting for some folks to finish their coding assignment 04, let's study/review a new trick. Those examples can be over-simplifying the power of functions, but I think it offers short yet useful overview of what it is.

#### Q1. Please review all three examples I have created in ```Functions.ipynb```. [Right click the link to save](http://www.compsaver.net/downloads/Assignment05_Functions.ipynb), then open using Jupyter Notebook. Read notes and comments in between code carefully and try your best to understand what does a function do.

#### Q2. Revise the last example ```Checking Palindrome``` to make it a function that returns a ```boolean``` value (that is either ```True``` or ```False```). It will be just like the ```example 2``` version of the ```example 1```. If a text you are evaluating is a palindrome, your function will return ```True``` from the function.

```python
def ___________(1)________________:  #name it properly (some hint below)
    # start to write your code below this line.
    # Let's call your function body as the blank 2.



    # The end of the function should be like this: 
    # if it is a palindrome return True, else return False

print("The result of the evaluation is (In True/False) :")

# You are invoking your newly created function from the line below:
print(getPalindromeResult(______)) #Fill in any text you want to test.

```
