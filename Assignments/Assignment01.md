## Assignment 01 - Coding Exercise

### Please use Anaconda/Spyder (or your favorite python editor) to run the following code. Then, answer the short questions.


#### Q1. Please try your best to guess. What did the code block has achieved?
```python
import math
radius = 20
area = radius * radius * math.pi

```

#### Q2. Please continue to write down the following code below the code block above. What do you think the round() function has achieved?

area = round(area, 2)
print(area)
```

#### Q3. Please continue to execute the following code. What is the role of ord() function? 
```
print(ord("a"))
print(ord("b"))
print(ord("c"))
print(ord("A"))
print(ord("B"))
print(ord("C"))
```

#### Q4. Please execute the following code. Discuss the role of chr() and len() function here.
```
string = (chr(100) + chr(101) + chr(102) + chr(103))
print(string)

print(len(string))
print(len("defgh"))
print(len("defghi"))
```
